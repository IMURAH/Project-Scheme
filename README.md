#### Summary
Lee county is organizing a county fair over the upcoming summer. You along with one
other friend plan to participate in several games including the bucket ball game. Each
player will be assigned a bucket to start with and the player that gets the bucket with the
highest worth wins the game.  
The worth of each bucket is calculated as per the rules
below. A bucket contains 10 balls of four different colors â€“ red, blue, white, and green. Each
red is worth 10 points, each green is worth 15 points, each blue ball is worth 20 points,
and each white ball is worth 1 point.  
We used *Scheme* to look at the bucket and decide how many points it's worth and break down the elements of the bucket.
